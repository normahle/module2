            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 - 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer,<br> chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.<br> She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation,<br> and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.<br> As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.

            In 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine.<br> Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy,<br> transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842.<br> Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English.<br> She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage.<br> These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.
